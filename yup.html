Joanne Rowling (31.07.1965) - English writer.
Joanne Rowling (pen-name J. K. Rowling) is a famous British novelist. Her fantasy books about Harry Potter brought her world recognition and popularity. They became the best-selling books in the history of literature. These books have become the basis for a series of films, which were also highly successful. The writer was born on July 31st, 1965, in Yate, which is north-east of Bristol. Her father was an engineer and her mother was a science technician. When Joanne was four, her family moved to Winterbourne. She attended St Michael’s Primary School there. Many biographers believe that the headmaster of that school became the prototype of the headmaster of the fictional school of magic in “Harry Potter”.
She started writing fictional stories rather early, at the age of nine. Her first listener was her younger sister Dianne. Joanne became genuinely interested in literature after she got Jessica Mitford’s autobiography. This author became her idol and she wanted to be like her. Joanne’s childhood wasn’t easy. Her mother was often ill and she had to take care of herself and her sister. School years were also difficult. During one interview she confessed that this was a terrible time for her. In 1982, she failed the exams to Oxford. Nevertheless, she managed to enter the Exeter University. In 1986, she moved to London and started working as a secretary at the research department. Later, she met her boyfriend and moved to Manchester with him. The intention to write a fiction about a magical school came to her unexpectedly.
Soon, her mother died and it had a great influence on her novel. She described in details what Harry felt after the loss of his parents in her first book. In 1991, she went to Portugal to teach English. She was convinced that this job is for her. Every morning and evening she had free time to write the novel, in the afternoons she was teaching. In Portugal she met her future husband, who was a journalist. In 1993, she had a daughter Jessica. However, her marriage didn’t last. She soon got divorced and moved to Edinburgh with her daughter. In Scotland she received a grant to finish the novel about “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”. It wasn’t easy to sell it at first. Finally the book was bought by “Bloomsbury” publishing office.
A few months later the rights to her book were bought by one US publishing house, which made her a generous offer. As an author she got a sufficient amount of money, so that she could quit teaching. The book soon received a number of awards. The sequel of Joanne’s story was released next year. The writer quickly achieved world recognition and became an international literary sensation. All in all, she wrote seven books about Harry Potter. Apart from that, she created a number of novels which are somehow connected with the Hogwarts magical world.

 <u> Harry Potter</u> is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[2] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[3] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[4] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[5]
Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[6] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into eighty languages.[7] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[8] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.
The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.
